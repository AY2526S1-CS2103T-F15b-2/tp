**NUS Event Mailer Pro (NUS EMP) is a desktop app that helps you manage hundreds of events and contacts quickly and easily.** It's designed for speed and simplicity, as most actions can be done by typing commands directly, allowing you to work quickly without relying on menus or complex navigation. NUS Event Mailer Pro keeps your workflow smooth, so you can focus on running great events, not managing data.

* If you are interested in using NUS EMP, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUS EMP, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
