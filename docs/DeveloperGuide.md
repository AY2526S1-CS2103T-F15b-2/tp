## **2. System Architecture**

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

[Enhanced Architecture Diagram placeholder]

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with five main components:

- **UI**: JavaFX-based graphical interface with command terminal
- **Logic**: Command parsing and execution engine
- **Model**: Data entities and state management
- **Storage**: JSON-based persistence layer
- **Commons**: Shared utilities and core components

### 2.2 Component Overview

#### 2.2.1 Main Component

The `Main` class handles application lifecycle:

- Initializes components in correct sequence during startup
- Manages graceful shutdown with cleanup operations
- Coordinates component dependencies and wiring

#### 2.2.2 UI Component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nusemp/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Ui Class Diagram"/>

The UI component consists of:

- `MainWindow`: Primary application window
- `CommandBox`: User input interface
- `ResultDisplay`: Command feedback display
- Both of `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay` are automatically hidden, unless the user presses the terminal button located on the sidebar or presses the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + T) which will bring them up
- `ContactListPanel`/`EventListPanel`: Data presentation panels that fetch their data from the `model` component
- `StatusBarFooter`: Status information display

All UI components inherit from `UiPart` abstract class and use FXML for layout definitions.

#### 2.2.3 Logic Component

**API**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nusemp/logic/Logic.java)

The Logic component manages:

- **Command parsing**: Translates user input into executable commands
- **Command execution**: Executes commands against the model
- **Result formatting**: Returns formatted results to the UI

Key classes:

- `LogicManager`: Main logic coordinator
- `AppParser`: Routes commands to appropriate parsers
- `Command` hierarchy: Individual command implementations

#### 2.2.4 Model Component

**API**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nusemp/model/Model.java)

The Model component maintains application state:

- **Data storage**: `UniqueContactList`, `UniqueEventList`
- **Filtered views**: Observable lists for UI binding
- **User preferences**: Application settings and preferences
- **Data relationships**: Contact-event associations

#### 2.2.5 Storage Component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F15b-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nusemp/storage/Storage.java)

The Storage component handles persistence:

- **JSON serialization**: Convert objects to/from JSON
- **File operations**: Read/write data files
- **Backup management**: Automatic backup creation
- **Corruption handling**: Data recovery mechanisms

#### 2.2.6 Commons Component

The Commons component provides shared utilities:

- **Core classes**: AppParameters, CommandType enum, Messages constants
- **Utilities**: String formatting, collection utilities, validation helpers
- **Exceptions**: Base exception classes for error handling
- **Logging**: Centralized logging configuration and utilities

### 2.3 Component Interactions

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentInteractionSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" alt="Component Interaction Sequence Diagram"/>

The components interact through well-defined interfaces:

- UI calls Logic to execute commands
- Logic updates Model state
- Model notifies UI of changes through observable lists
- Storage persists Model data on changes

## **4. Command System**

### 4.1 Command Processing Flow

[Command Processing Sequence Diagram placeholder]

The command system follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Input Parsing**: `AppParser` routes commands to specific parsers
2. **Command Creation**: Parsers create appropriate `Command` objects
3. **Validation**: Model validates entities on construction, Commands validate business rules, Storage validates data integrity
4. **Execution**: Commands execute against the model
5. **Result Formatting**: Success/error messages returned to UI

### 4.2 Command Categories

#### 4.2.1 Contact Commands

- `contact add`: Add new contact with name, email, phone, address, and tags
- `contact delete`: Remove contact by index
- `contact edit`: Modify contact details (name, email, phone, address, tags)
- `contact find`: Search contacts by keywords or specific fields
- `contact list`: Display all contacts with indices
- `contact show`: View contact details and associated events

#### 4.2.2 Event Commands

- `event add`: Create new event with name, date, address, and tags
- `event delete`: Remove event by index
- `event edit`: Modify event details (name, date, address, status, tags)
- `event list`: Display all events with indices and status
- `event show`: View event details and associated contacts
- `event link`: Associate contacts with events
- `event unlink`: Remove contact associations from events
- `event export`: Export all contacts from an event to clipboard
- `event rsvp`: Update contact's RSVP status for an event

#### 4.2.3 System Commands

- `help`: Display command help (opens user guide in browser)
- `exit`: Terminate application

### 4.3 Parser Architecture

[Parser Architecture Diagram placeholder]

The parser system uses a direct interface implementation approach:

- `Parser<T>`: Generic interface for all command parsers
- `AppParser`: Main command router using regex patterns and CommandType enum
- Individual parsers: Each implements `Parser<SpecificCommand>` directly
- `CommandType` enum: Routes commands to appropriate parsing logic (CONTACT, EVENT, HELP, EXIT, UNKNOWN)

**Key Components:**

- `BASIC_COMMAND_FORMAT`: Initial command type separation
- `CONTACT_COMMAND_FORMAT`: Contact command parsing pattern
- `EVENT_COMMAND_FORMAT`: Event command parsing pattern
- `ArgumentTokenizer`: Handles prefix-based argument parsing (--name, -n, etc.)

### 4.4 Error Handling Flow

<puml src="diagrams/ErrorHandlingFlowDiagram.puml" alt="Error Handling Flow Diagram"/>

Error handling follows these principles:

- **Input validation**: Validate before processing using `ParseException`
- **Command execution errors**: Handle runtime errors using `CommandException`
- **Clear messages**: Use `Messages` class constants for consistent error feedback
- **Logging**: Log parsing failures using `LogsCenter` for debugging
- **Exception propagation**: Handle at appropriate levels (parsing vs execution)

**Exception Types:**

- `ParseException`: Input format and validation errors
- `CommandException`: Command execution errors
- `IllegalValueException`: Base class for parsing-related errors

---

## **6. Advanced Topics**

### 6.1 Observable Pattern Implementation

The application uses JavaFX's observable pattern for real-time UI updates:

```java
// In ModelManager
private final ObservableList<Contact> filteredContacts = FXCollections.observableArrayList();

// UI components bind to this list
contactListPanel.setItems(model.getFilteredContactList());
```

**Key Features:**

- **Automatic UI updates**: When Model data changes, UI updates automatically
- **Invalidation mechanism**: Contacts and Events use invalidationToggle field with immutable pattern to force observable list refreshes through object replacement
- **Filtered views**: Separate observable lists for filtered and all data
- **Decoupled architecture**: UI doesn't need to know when data changes
- **Efficient updates**: Only UI components that display changed data are updated

### 6.2 Performance Considerations

#### 6.2.1 Data Scaling

- Application supports up to 10,000 contacts and 1,000 events
- Observable lists use efficient change detection
- JSON serialization optimized for large datasets
- UI virtualization for large lists (if implemented)

#### 6.2.2 Memory Management

- Immutable objects prevent memory leaks
- Weak references in event listeners
- Proper cleanup in component disposal

### 6.3 Common Debugging Scenarios

#### 6.3.1 Command Not Found

1. Check command registration in AppParser
2. Verify parser class exists and is accessible
3. Validate command word spelling

#### 6.3.2 Data Not Persisting

1. Check file permissions
2. Verify JSON serialization works
3. Check storage file paths
4. Look for corruption handling in logs

#### 6.3.3 UI Not Updating

2. Check for invalidation toggle usage
3. Ensure proper list change notifications

### 6.4 Extension Points

#### 6.4.1 Custom Commands

- Extend `Command` base class
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling

#### 6.4.2 New Entity Types

- Create entity classes following Contact/Event patterns
- Add to Model component interfaces
- Implement storage serialization
- Create appropriate UI components

#### 6.4.3 Storage Backends

- Implement `Storage` interface
- Handle serialization format
- Maintain existing API contracts
